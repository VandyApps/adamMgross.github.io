### On Tuesday, November 15

From 7:30 - 9:30 pm in FGH 143, we will be holding a coding competition as part of Engineering Day (E-Day) called Code Golf!
The point of this competition is to correctly answer a set of coding questions while writing as little code as possible. This is a popular type of coding competition, and [here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) more info about this type of game.

The competition will be open to everyone and questions will span a broad spectrum of difficulty levels, so don't worry if you're not a software genius.

### What to expect:
* great music
* free pizza
* prizes for the top 3 finishers

So we hope to see you there!
