Vandyapps is cool, checkout their [website](http://adammgross.github.io).
Here is an example of some python code:
    
    from sets import Set
    def char_in_set(str, set):
        char_set = Set(set)
        for i, char in enumerate(str):
            if char in char_set:
                return i

        return None
